# Advising-Program
In the projects for this course, the problem being solved was the development of a Course Advising Software. The software needed to store information about courses, including their course numbers, names, and prerequisites. It should be able to load data from a file, display a list of courses, and provide information about specific courses and their prerequisites.

To approach the problem, I considered the requirements and constraints and decided to use a hash table as the main data structure to store the course objects. The hash table allows for efficient retrieval of course information based on course numbers, which is a key requirement of the software. I implemented the hash table using a map container in C++, where the course number serves as the key and the course object as the value. Understanding data structures is crucial for efficient problem solving, memory management, and algorithm design. 

Throughout the development process, I ran into roadblocks such as file handling, parsing data from the file, and ensuring the accuracy of the program logic. To overcome these roadblocks, I applied debugging techniques and watched tutorials.

Working on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. I learned the value of choosing appropriate data structures to efficiently solve a problem. Understanding data structures helps in optimizing the program's performance and providing the required functionality. In this project, by carefully selecting a hash table as the main data structure, I achieved efficient retrieval of course information and streamlined the program's overall execution.

My work on this project has changed the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I focused on modularizing the code into functions with clear responsibilities, which improves code readability and maintainability. I also used error handling and input validation to handle unexpected situations. Additionally, I separated the core logic from the user interface, allowing for easier modifications or additions to the software's features in the future.
